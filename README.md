# Portfolio Project
Project Name: My First Portfolio Website
Project Description:
This is my first personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases my skills, projects, and provides a way to connect with me. The goal of this project is to create a professional online presence where potential employers, clients, or collaborators can learn more about me, my work, and my expertise.

The website is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all screen sizes, from desktop to mobile. It also includes interactive elements, such as smooth scrolling, hover effects, and a dynamic contact form.
